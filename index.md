# Wendi’s Grotto

Welcome.

This is a personal space where I share **technical writing, research notes, and reflections** — on engineering, growth, and inner worlds.

Some texts are practical and technical, others more reflective or exploratory.  
All of them are written with the same intention: to think carefully, learn openly, and build bridges between people, ideas, and disciplines.

More content will appear here gradually.

## Math test :)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
