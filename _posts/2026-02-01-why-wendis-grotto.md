I wanted a place of my own on the internet.

Not a platform, not a feed. Just a place.

Here, I plan to share different kinds of writing: reflections about myself and others, thoughts and ideas, images, research notes, engineering topics, and fragments that don’t always fit neatly into a category.

The structure of the site reflects this diversity.  

- *Posts* are for more regular writing.  
- *Research & Archives* gathers earlier work from my past life in computer science and software engineering.  
- *Projects* is a space for ongoing or new initiatives, whether professional or personal.  
- And *Unconscious* is where I allow myself to share much more personal material.

Together, these sections reflect different facets of who I am, and how I think.

This site will evolve slowly.  
There is no fixed plan. Only a direction.

If you’re here, welcome.
