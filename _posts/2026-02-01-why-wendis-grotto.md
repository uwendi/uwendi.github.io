I wanted a place of my own on the internet.

Not a platform, not a feed. Just a place.

Wendi’s Grotto is where I plan to share different kinds of writing:
technical notes, research reflections, and more personal texts.
Some are precise and practical, others more exploratory.

What connects them is the same intention:
to think carefully, learn openly, and to give shape to thoughts and intuitions that are still forming.

This site will evolve slowly.
There is no fixed plan, only a direction.

If you’re here, welcome.
